Feel free to get a cup of coffee and stay a while. While you're here, Take a look at our Graph about unemployement, which were picked from credible sources I can find. Take a look at the opinion board, where i display my opinions about the subject. There are also the job possibilities that people can look into, especially during this situation. And last, but not least, The statistics about unemployement specifically before COVID-19.
