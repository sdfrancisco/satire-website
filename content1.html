		<h2> Entry 1: Thoughts on Unemployement during COVID-19 (Opinionated)</h2>
		My opinion on Unemployement and COVID-19 is that both should not be a problem in society, to the point that it affects even the hard working people. What i want to see in this country, for a start, is that the country implement ways for people to work, even in these times, by paralellizing work, thus speeding up processes and freeing time to do more recreational activities. A way to paralellize work is to give people work that they are assigned to do for the day/week/month, where it is up to them to do this. This will be done by multiple people, where work that is being relied on to be done by other employees will have to be done earlier. My second opinion is the employers and the government make job slots where people can work at home, like data processing, document evaluation and research, which does not rely too much on other people to be able to work. And last for this entry, I'd want the ability to be able to apply for jobs easily if i was looking for them. Something like an employee-employer matcher s		ystem, where the employees can look for employers that they qualify for, and employers can recieve job requests and accept them based on their resume.
		<h2> Entry 2: Thoughts on Unemployement (Satirical)</h2>
		What can we do about this problem? Well, to eliminate the problem, let’s remove what causes it. My first proposition is to completely remove jobs outright. No jobs, no unemployment, right? How can we survive you ask? All wealth, products, and all assets will be collected and divided among all the people equally. Imagine everybody having the same wealth as anybody else, who needs to work right? 
		If it does not work, then let’s try this plan. Man will not be satisfied with the conditions sited above. If this happens then we will simplify the process of looking and having a job. If you want a job and apply for it, you will have it, no requirements, no qualifications, nothing. You can even demand for whatever salary you want. We can take it further by revising the definition of a job. A job will be anything that you do and I mean anything. Imagine being paid for breathing. Why do you say? Remember that humans exhale carbon dioxide which is needed by plants in photosynthesis. You can be called as a “carbon dioxide producer” and be paid for exhaling. I cannot imagine anybody not wanting to have this job. This will result to 100% employment. Then you will be rewarded for having a job. You will be paid just by having a job, period.
		For a last-ditch effort, here is what we do. We will round up everybody who becomes jobless. They will be placed in a facility where they will be “utilized” for whatever purpose we need. For example, they can be used as guinea pigs for medical purposes. They can be injected with deadly viruses and then followed by proposed or experimental vaccines. If they die then that vaccine does not work but if they live and get well then, they will be released and required to get a job. If they cannot find a job (forgot to breathe again?) then they will go back to the facility. We can also harvest internal organs from the jobless and place it in the bodies of those in need. The remains can then be fed to animals. Decays can be used as fertilizers of plants. No waste, right? Those in the facility can also be made to build infrastructure projects like bridges, buildings, dams and the like. They will be forced to work until they can no longer live. You can also buy a slave in that place to do anything you wish. You better 		get a job or end up in this facility. You would wish to be in hell than in that place.
		<h2> Entry 3: Thoughts on Unemployement (Realistic)</h2>
		For real solutions, government and the private sector should work hand in hand and create an environment that would make jobs more available. The government should stir the economy by spending money on infrastructure and lending to the private sector. This will create jobs and address the unemployment. Invest on education so people are skilled and therefore can likely find a job. Make a survey of those unemployed, their skills and reason for not being unemployed. Match it up to the requirements of the private companies and help them get a job. Encourage people to open business by lending capital to them. Spread development in the rural areas to discourage migration to urban areas. This will also solve overcrowding in urban areas. Solve the peace and order situation of our country. This will encourage foreign investments and therefore create more jobs and job opportunities. Addressing the over population and environment degradation problem will also help in the unemployment issue. Lastly but most importantly		, stop corruption. Need I say more?
		<h2> Entry 4: Thoughts on Unemployement (Newspaper Cartoon interpretation)</h2>
		<img width=99% src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/unemployment-issue-manila-philippines-qurino-grandstand-june-job-seeker-th-independence-day-job-fair-jobless-rate-31604872.jpg"> This is an image of a Job fair in the Phillipines. You may be asking why i started this entry off with a non-cartoon image. I'll explain during the intertpretations of the cartoons. <img width=99% src="https://media.philstar.com/photos/2020/06/08/edicartoon-6-9_2020-06-08_20-55-08.jpg"> This cartoon is how 7.3 million  extra unemployed people dodged COVID-19, due to them being unemployed. <img width=99% src=https://media.philstar.com/images/the-philippine-star/opinion/20160707/startoon.jpg> This shows how big of a problem Unemployment truly is in the Philippines. <img width=99% src="https://media.philstar.com/images/articles/startoon_2018-05-01_20-34-18.jpg"> This was made when there were kuwait OFWs being repatriated at the start of COVID-19, and these people were just a fraction of the unemployed in the Philippines at the time. <img width=99% src="https://www.manilatimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/edit20171213.jpg"> This time from a different newspaper, therefore a different artist, This shows that there are many filipinos who are unemployed, and is too commmon, as shown by an unusually large man. <img width=99% src="https://www.manilatimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/edit20190503.jpg"> This shows that illegal Chinese workers are being chosen over the unemployed of our own. This is likely corruption of the government and possibly an assimilation to China. <img width=99% src="https://media.philstar.com/photos/2019/04/30/freetoon_2019-04-30_22-22-38.jpg"> Finally, this is what the labor force is recieving from the government. Since the job fair is about employment, this shows how little the government is doing to convince or support the unemployed to seek for a job. This is what the government does for the unemployed. If that's the only thing they do for the currently 10 million filipinos that are of age that have no jobs (<a href= graph.html>Graph</a>), this means that either the governemnt deosn't want to solve the problem, or they have the capability to, and they are clearly showing at least one of those.
